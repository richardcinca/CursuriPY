# Main takeaways: 
    #   It's easier to work with functions and assemble them in the needed order, instead of just writing the program 
    #   Some parts of the code might be not necessary or could be written in a simpler way. Sometimes it's a "there I fixed it" kind of code. 
            # ex.1: maybe using a 10 element list for 9 cells. Should have used a matrix, df instead?
            # ex.2: trying to find a place to put the "break" - it seams unclear the concept of breaking when the code is a bit larger
            # ex.3: CPU_hand
    #   Try to create a clear "framework" for the code, a clear set of instructions with the order you need them to be executed. 
    # After that, mostly it's just translating the instructions
